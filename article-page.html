When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of his regiment, when he recognized red-haired Deméntyev and saw the picket ropes of the roan horses, when Lavrúshka gleefully shouted to his master, “The count has come!” and Denísov, who had been asleep on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him, and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival, Rostóv experienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his sister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and precious as his parents’ house.</p></div><div class="article__picture"><picture><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="img/content/article__img_1@tablet.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="img/content/article__img_1@tablet.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="img/content/article__img_1@desktope.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="article__img" src="img/content/article__img_1@desktope.jpg" alt="article image"></picture></div><div class="article__picture-label"><p>This allows your final design to look deliberate, professional, and consistent.</p></div><div class="article__paragraph"><p>When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone out foraging, when he had again entered into all the little interests of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one narrow, unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense of peace, of moral support, and the same sense of being at home here in his own place, as he had felt under the parental roof.</p></div><div class="article__header"><h2>H2 Chapter XV</h2></div><div class="article__paragraph"><p>The whole world was divided into two unequal parts: one, our Pávlograd regiment; the other, all the rest. And the rest was no concern of his. In the regiment, everything was definite: who was lieutenant, who captain, who was a good fellow, who a bad one, and most of all, who was a comrade. The canteenkeeper gave one credit, one’s pay came every four months, there was nothing to think out or decide, you had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the Pávlograd regiment and, when given an order, to do what was clearly, distinctly, and definitely ordered—and all would be well.</p><p>Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental life, Rostóv felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to rest. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was all the pleasanter for him, because, after his loss to Dólokhov (for which, in spite of all his family’s efforts to console him, he could not forgive himself), he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving, not as he had done before, but really well, and by being a perfectly first-rate comrade and officer—in a word, a splendid man altogether, a thing which seemed so difficult out in the world, but so possible in the regiment.</p></div><div class="article__header"><h3>H3 How do you measure by baseline?</h3></div><div class="article__paragraph"><p>The officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless, half-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and, in general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied themselves as before, some playing cards (there was plenty of money, though there was no food), some with more innocent games, such as quoits and skittles. The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of, partly because nothing certain was known about it, partly because there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly.</p><p>Rostóv lived, as before, with Denísov, and since their furlough they had become more friendly than ever. Denísov never spoke of Rostóv’s family, but by the tender friendship his commander showed him, Rostóv felt that the elder hussar’s luckless love for Natásha played a part in strengthening their friendship. Denísov evidently tried to expose Rostóv to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action greeted his safe return with evident joy. On one of his foraging expeditions, in a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of provisions, Rostóv found a family consisting of an old Pole and his daughter with an infant in arms. They were half clad, hungry, too weak to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance. Rostóv brought them to his quarters, placed them in his own lodging, and kept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering.</p></div><div class="article__slider"><div class="article__slider-nav article__slider-nav--prev"><svg class="svg-sprite-icon icon-arrow icon-arrow--left" aria-label="slider button left" width="28" height="16" viewBox="0 0 39 26"><use xlink:href="img/svg/sprite.svg#arrow"></use></svg></div><div class="article__slider-nav article__slider-nav--next"><svg class="svg-sprite-icon icon-arrow icon-arrow--right" aria-label="slider button right" width="28" height="16" viewBox="0 0 39 26"><use xlink:href="img/svg/sprite.svg#arrow"></use></svg></div><div class="article__slider-body"><div class="article__slider-item"><picture><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="img/content/article__slider-img_1@tablet.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="img/content/article__slider-img_1@tablet.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="img/content/article__slider-img_1@desktope.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="article__slider-img" src="img/content/article__slider-img_1@desktope.jpg" alt="article slider image"></picture><div class="article__picture-label"> <p>This allows your final design to look deliberate, professional, and consistent.</p></div></div><div class="article__slider-item"><picture><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="img/content/article__slider-img_2@tablet.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="img/content/article__slider-img_2@tablet.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="img/content/article__slider-img_2@desktope.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="article__slider-img" src="img/content/article__slider-img_2@desktope.jpg" alt="article slider image"></picture><div class="article__picture-label"> <p>This allows your final design to look deliberate, professional, and consistent.</p></div></div><div class="article__slider-item"><picture><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="img/content/article__slider-img_3@tablet.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="img/content/article__slider-img_3@tablet.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 1025px)" srcset="img/content/article__slider-img_3@desktope.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="article__slider-img" src="img/content/article__slider-img_3@desktope.jpg" alt="article slider image"></picture><div class="article__picture-label"> <p>This allows your final design to look deliberate, professional, and consistent.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article__paragraph"><p>In April, Rostóv was on orderly duty.

He arranged dining and funeral lodge meetings, enrolled new members, and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic charters. He gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms, in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular. He supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in Petersburg.</p></div><div class="article__header"><h3>H3 Table</h3></div><div class="article__table"><table><thead><tr><th>Traditional Rental</th><th>Ecommerce</th><th>3rd Column</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>If you find what you need in the store, you can grab it right away without having to wait for the time it takes to ship</td><td>The time investment is much smaller.

At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order. When he had joined the Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently steps onto the smooth surface of a bog. When he put his foot down it sank in. To make quite sure of the firmness of the ground, he put his other foot down and sank deeper still, became stuck in it, and involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog.</p></div><div class="article__iframe"><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdigitalkward%2Fphotos%2Fa.10151733082295472%2F10153080498765472%2F%3Ftype%3D3&width=500" width="100%" height="633" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></div><div class="article__iframe"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_fZq2MAHMk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF;
