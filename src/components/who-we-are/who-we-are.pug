      h3 Mariah Tritz
      p My name is Mariah Tritz and massage therapy is my passion! I have done other jobs in the past but never have I looked forward to getting up each morning to help the clients that come in my door. Now I do! I achieved many goals while attending the Denver School of Massage Therapy including 4.0 honor roll and clinic professionalism awards. I loved every minute of my education and was ever more excited to start my new career.
      p I am very active. Other than my massage work I also ride and train horses, love hiking Colorado, and playing with my dogs. In my activity I have also managed to hurt myself in different ways. This pain turned me onto massage therapy and over the years took me to the Denver School of Massage therapy to help people in similar ways to which I was helped.
      p I spend a great deal of time reading and learning all that I can about massage to stay up to date with all of the new and different techniques that are available to help my clients. I also spend time studying the human anatomy for specific client injuries or common issues I hear people complain about on the street. I want to be able to address each ailment that comes to me for help in the most professional manner and with as much knowledge as I can.

        h3 Sydney - LMT
        p Sydney became interested in massage through her own experiences. Having always been athletic and adventurous, but lacking a recovery plan, she sought the help of a massage therapist. Her quality of life improved dramatically after being encouraged to learn more about her body, how it moves, and what to do in order to maintain healthy joints and muscles.
        p She has a passion for helping clients maintain their bodies in peak performance. Whether you are an athlete overcoming pain or injury, or the office professional dealing with stress and the side effects of desk work, she aims to provide bodywork which addresses specific client goals for living an active, pain-free life. Sydney understands that each client has there own unique need for massage, so she helps to create treatment plans which include massage, stretching and at home self-maintenance. Sydney will be moving out of state and we are very sad to see her go! Her last day will be August 19th, 2018. If you want to see her one last time make sure to get an appointment soon!
